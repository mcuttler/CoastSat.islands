# CoastSat.islands
Satellite-derived shorelines and 2D planform measurements for islands, extension of the CoastSat toolbox.

This toolkit is an extension of the main [CoastSat toolbox](https://github.com/kvos/CoastSat), it enables users to measure shoreline position and two-dimensional planform characteristics (area and orientation) for islands.

The methodology is described in: Cuttler MVW, Vos K, Branson P, Hansen JE, O'Leary M, Browne NK, Lowe RJ (2020) Reef island response to climate-driven variations in water level and wave climate (under review).

To run the examples you will need to install the `coastsat` environment (instructions in the main [CoastSat toolbox](https://github.com/kvos/CoastSat)).

If you want to use [FES2014](https://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/es/data/products/auxiliary-products/global-tide-fes/description-fes2014.html) global tide model to get the tide levels at the time of image acquisition, follow the [instructions](https://github.com/kvos/CoastSat.slope/blob/master/doc/FES2014_installation.md) provided to setup the model.
